2. Save as MP3 files
3. Upload to your website hosting
4. Update the onclick function to play actual audio

**Example code to add:**
```javascript
<audio id="aurora-message" src="aurora-message.mp3"></audio>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('aurora-message').play()">
```

### **Expandable Sections:**
Click "📖 Read the Message" to expand

Smooth CSS animations  
Works perfectly on mobile!
