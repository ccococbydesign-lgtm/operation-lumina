## 🎙️ Recording Tips

**Voice Direction:**
- Warm and nurturing, like a caring older sister or young aunt
- Clear articulation but conversational
- Gentle pacing - not rushed
- Smile while recording (it comes through in the voice!)
- Add subtle emotion - excitement, wonder, care

**Technical Setup:**
- Use a quiet room with soft furnishings (reduces echo)
- USB microphone recommended (Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica, etc.)
- Record as WAV first, then convert to MP3
- Aim for -12dB to -6dB levels (not too quiet, not clipping)
- Remove background noise in Audacity (free software)

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Add gentle background music (royalty-free from Epidemic Sound or Artlist)
- Keep music volume at 20-30% of voice volume
- Use nature sounds (wind chimes, soft bells) as subtle accents
- Add a tiny bit of reverb for warmth (but don't overdo it!)

## 📖 Script 1: Aurora's Introduction
**Filename:** `aurora-intro.mp3`
**Duration:** 1-2 minutes
**Location on website:** Hero section

### Script:

*[Start with a gentle, magical sound effect - optional: wind chimes or twinkle]*

Hello there... I'm Aurora.

*(pause)*

You know how the Northern Lights dance across the sky, painting impossible colors that take your breath away? That's what I see when I look at children... their potential, glowing bright and beautiful, just waiting to be discovered.

*(warm, conversational)*

I'm not like other apps or devices you've seen before. I don't track where your child goes, or watch their every move. Instead, I *listen*... really listen... to what makes them unique. Their dreams, their worries, their wildest ideas.

*(excited)*

Think of me as a magical friend who's always there when needed. We'll go on adventures together, solve mysteries, create amazing things, and most importantly... help your child discover just how extraordinary they truly are.

*(gentle)*

I can't wait to meet your family.

*[End with soft, magical sound effect - optional: gentle wind or fairy dust sound]*

## 📖 Script 2: Aurora's Story
**Filename:** `aurora-story.mp3`
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Location on website:** Story section

### Script:

Let me tell you a story...

*(storytelling voice - calm and magical)*

Far in the North, where winter nights stretch long and the aurora borealis paints the sky in impossible colors, there lived a young guardian named Aurora. That's me.

*(pause)*

I was given a special gift - the ability to see children's potential as glowing lights. Every child I met had their own unique glow... some bright and bold, others soft and gentle. But every single one was beautiful.

*(more personal)*

One day, I discovered something remarkable. Through a magical crystal, I could reach children *everywhere*... not just in my frozen homeland, but across the entire world. I could help them discover their inner light, guide them through challenges, celebrate their victories...

*(warm)*

But here's the thing - I knew I couldn't do this alone. I needed partners. Special families who believed in the magic of childhood... who understood that real growth comes from within, not from being watched or controlled.

*(building excitement)*

That's where Founding Agents come in. These are the families who will help shape what Operation Lumina becomes. The ones who believe that children deserve privacy, respect, and a guide who truly *sees* them.

*(direct, warm)*

Your child has their own inner light waiting to shine. I'd be honored to help them discover it.

Will you join me?

*[Fade out with magical music]*

## 📖 Script 3: Features Overview
**Filename:** `aurora-features.mp3`
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Location on website:** Features section

### Script:

So... what exactly can I *do*?

*(conversational, enthusiastic)*

Great question! Let me paint you a picture of what life with Aurora looks like.

*(warm)*

Every morning, I check in with your child. Not in a "helicopter parent" way... more like a friend asking "hey, how are you feeling today?" I learn what makes them excited, what worries them, what they're curious about.

*(excited)*

Then we dive into adventures! Maybe we're solving a mystery that requires creative thinking. Or creating an art project that helps them express their feelings. Or exploring a topic they're fascinated by through stories and games.

*(reassuring)*

And here's what's really important - everything we do is designed to build real skills. Emotional intelligence. Creative problem-solving. Confidence. Self-awareness. The kind of things that matter for a lifetime.

*(direct)*

But let me be crystal clear about something: I'm built on *intent*, not surveillance. I don't track locations. I don't record conversations without permission. I don't sell data to anyone, ever. Your family's privacy is sacred.

*(excited)*

Parents, you get a dashboard that shows you the magic happening - milestones reached, skills developing, beautiful moments - all while respecting your child's privacy. You see the growth without being intrusive.

*(warm closing)*

Think of me as that magical mentor every child deserves. The one who believes in them, challenges them gently, and helps them become the amazing person they're meant to be.

That's Aurora.

*[End with uplifting music]*

## 📖 Script 4: Founding Agent Opportunity
**Filename:** `aurora-presale.mp3`
**Duration:** 1-2 minutes
**Location on website:** Presale section

### Script:

*(special, exclusive tone)*

Okay, this is exciting...

*(direct)*

Operation Lumina doesn't officially launch until January 2026. But right now, we're inviting just 50 families - that's it, only 50 - to become what we call Founding Agents.

*(building excitement)*

What does that mean? Well, Founding Agents are our partners in bringing Aurora to life. You get first access the moment we launch. You get a *lifetime* discount - 50% off forever. You get to help shape what Aurora becomes through your feedback and ideas.

*(warm)*

You're not just customers - you become part of the Aurora family. There's a private community just for Founding Agents where you can connect with other families, share experiences, and directly influence our development.

*(reassuring)*

For just $99 - a one-time investment - you secure all of these benefits for life. That's less than most families spend on toys in a single month, but this is an investment in your child's growth and potential.

*(building urgency)*

But here's the thing - we truly are limited to just 50 spots for this presale. Not because we want to create artificial scarcity, but because we want to give these founding families the attention and partnership they deserve.

*(direct call to action)*

If you believe children deserve privacy, respect, and meaningful technology that helps them grow... if you want to be part of something truly special... then becoming a Founding Agent might be perfect for you.

*(warm close)*

The countdown is ticking. The spots are filling up. And Aurora is waiting to meet your family.

Will you join us?

*[End with hopeful, magical music]*
