## 📝 LEO'S WELCOME MESSAGE (90-105 seconds)

**[Soft, genuine opening]**

Hi. My name's Leo.

You might have heard about me in Aurora's story. I'm the boy she saved from drowning when I was seven years old.

**[Pause, remembering]**

I was swimming in the ocean with my family. The waves got really big, and... I went under. I couldn't get back up. I remember being so scared. Everything went dark.

**[Grateful]**

Then Aurora was there. She pulled me out of the water. She saved my life.

**[The turning point - thoughtful]**

But after I stopped coughing and could breathe again, I asked her something. I didn't mean to be rude or anything. I was just... confused.

I asked: "Why were you watching instead of helping?"

**[Pause - this is important]**

I didn't understand at the time, but that question changed everything. For me. For Aurora. For all of this.

**[More understanding now]**

See, Aurora had been watching me from far away - making sure I was being "good" - instead of being close enough to help when I needed her. And when I asked that question, she realized something really important.

**[Warm, inclusive]**

Kids don't need someone watching them to see if they're naughty or nice. Kids need someone who's there. Someone who sees them. Someone who helps them grow.

**[Personal growth]**

That's what Operation Lumina is about. It's about being seen for who you really are - not just what you do right or wrong. It's about learning that your intentions matter. That trying counts. That making mistakes is how you grow.

**[A little vulnerable]**

After the ocean thing, I was scared for a long time. Scared of water. Scared of trying new things. Scared of messing up.

**[Hopeful]**

But Aurora showed me a different way. She helped me understand that being scared doesn't make you bad. Making mistakes doesn't mean you're not good enough. It just means you're learning.

**[Invitation]**

That's why I'm Founding Agent Number One. Not because I'm perfect - I'm definitely not. But because I learned that what matters is why you do things, not just whether you do them perfectly.

**[Encouraging conclusion]**

If you're thinking about joining Operation Lumina, I want you to know something: You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to have it all figured out. You just have to try. You just have to care.

**[Warm closing]**

Aurora believed in me when I was scared and confused. Now I get to help her show other kids what she showed me.

**[Final thought - soft smile in voice]**

Maybe you'll be the next one to ask a question that changes everything.

I can't wait to meet you, agent.

**[END - total time approximately 90-105 seconds]**

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE SHORTER VERSION (60 seconds)

**[If you need a condensed version]**

Hi. I'm Leo. I'm nine years old, and I'm Founding Agent Number One of Operation Lumina.

Two years ago, when I was seven, I almost drowned in the ocean. Aurora saved my life. After she pulled me out, I asked her a question: "Why were you watching instead of helping?"

That question changed everything.

Aurora realized that kids don't need to be watched and judged. They need to be seen and helped. That's what Operation Lumina is about - being seen for who you really are, not just what you do right or wrong.

After the ocean, I was scared for a long time. But Aurora showed me that being scared doesn't make you bad. Making mistakes doesn't mean you're not good enough. What matters is why you try, not whether you're perfect.

That's why I wanted to share my story with you. Because if you're thinking about joining, I want you to know: you don't have to be perfect. You just have to care.

Aurora believed in me when I was scared. Now I get to help her show other kids what she showed me.

I can't wait to meet you, agent.

## 💡 TIPS FOR GETTING THE BEST PERFORMANCE

### With Your Voice Actor:
1. **Share Leo's full backstory** from the Aurora origin story
2. **Explain the question's importance** - it literally created Operation Lumina
3. **Let them relate** to being scared, making mistakes, needing help
4. **Encourage genuine emotion** rather than "acting"
5. **Allow natural speech patterns** - kids say "like," pause, breathe

### Direction Phrases to Use:
- "Imagine you're talking to a younger kid who's nervous about joining"
- "You're remembering something scary but also something that made you stronger"
- "You really believe what you're saying - this helped you"
- "You're not trying to impress anyone, just being honest"
- "Take your time - you're thinking about what to say"

### If They Sound Too Rehearsed:
- Have them tell the story in their own words first
- Ask them about a time they were scared
- Talk about what it means to be brave
- Let them improvise parts
- Record conversational takes, then tighten to script
